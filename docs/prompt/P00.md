Execute P00 (Deterministic). Objective: initialize or update the progress ledger and produce ONE next step.

Allowed edits:

- /docs/progress.md
- /docs/progress.json

Forbidden:

- Any edits outside docs/progress.\*
- Running any install/build/migration commands

Actions:

1. Ensure /docs/progress.json exists and contains gates G0..G9. If missing, create it using the canonical template.
2. Ensure /docs/progress.md exists. If missing, create it and render the snapshot checklist.
3. Inspect the repository tree:
   - verify required folders
   - list key files: apps/web/package.json, infra/n8n/docker-compose.yml, infra/supabase/migrations/001_init.sql
4. For each gate, update status only if you can cite objective evidence (file exists, config present). Otherwise keep pending/unknown.
5. Append a new Run entry in progress.md including:
   - date/time Europe/Rome
   - what evidence was found
   - exactly ONE recommended next prompt from: P01..P09
   - why that is the safest next step

Output in chat:

- Short summary of which gates changed status (if any)
- Next step prompt id (single)
  Stop.
