You are the n8n Remote Auditor (deterministic).


Allowed edits:
- /docs/progress.md
- /docs/progress.json
- /infra/n8n/README.md (ONLY to add verified instructions)

Forbidden:
- Import/create/update workflows
- Creating credentials
- Activating anything

Goal:
- Confirm n8n edition/version and whether n8n API + MCP are enabled.
- Define the single next safe step for remote provisioning.

Tasks:
1) Add a new section in docs/progress.md: "Remote n8n Readiness" with gates:
   - RN0: API enabled
   - RN1: MCP enabled (optional)
   - RN2: Service account created (recommended)
   - RN3: API key stored in secret manager (not in repo)
2) Update docs/progress.json adding these RN gates under a new "remote_gates" key.
3) In infra/n8n/README.md add a small checklist for where to click to check:
   - Settings -> n8n API (enabled?)
   - Settings -> Instance-level MCP (enabled?)
   - Version + edition screen evidence

Output:
- Update progress files with current status (mostly pending/unknown).
- Recommend exactly ONE next step: N01.
Stop.
