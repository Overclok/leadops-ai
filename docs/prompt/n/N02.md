Execute N02 (Deterministic). Goal: verify n8n Public REST API reachable using API key, without modifying n8n.

Allowed edits:

- /docs/progress.md
- /docs/progress.json

Forbidden:

- Import/create/update workflows
- Creating credentials
- Activating workflows
- Storing secrets in repo

Assumptions:

- The runtime environment where you run this has:
  - N8N_BASE_URL
  - N8N_API_KEY
    (They must come from secret manager, not from repo files.)

Steps:

1. Perform a read-only call:
   GET ${N8N_BASE_URL}/api/v1/workflows?limit=1
   with headers:
   - X-N8N-API-KEY: ${N8N_API_KEY}
   - accept: application/json
2. Record ONLY:
   - HTTP status code
   - whether response is JSON
   - (optional) count of returned workflows
     Do NOT print the API key.
3. Update docs/progress.json:
   - Mark RN0 (API enabled) = done if status is 200
   - If 401 -> blocked with reason "auth failed"
   - If 404 -> blocked with reason "wrong base path"
4. Append a run entry to docs/progress.md with timestamp Europe/Rome and the result.
5. Output: recommend exactly one next step:
   - If 200: N03 (create idempotent n8n-sync tool in repo)
   - Else: stop and state what is blocked.

Stop.
