Execute N05 (Deterministic). Goal: prepare credential gating + tenant bootstrap + end-to-end signed event validation plan. Do NOT activate workflows yet.

Forbidden:

- Storing any secrets in repo
- Activating any n8n workflows
- Changing workflow JSON in /infra/n8n/workflows (unless a proven config bug exists; otherwise defer to N06)

Tasks:

1. Create /infra/n8n/credentials.md listing REQUIRED credentials with exact names to create in n8n UI:
   - LeadOpsAI - Gmail OAuth (Gmail API)
   - LeadOpsAI - Calendly Token/Webhook
   - LeadOpsAI - Vapi (and Twilio if applicable)
     For each: where to create, what scopes/permissions are needed, and how to verify with a harmless test execution.
     No placeholders, no secrets.

2. Create /infra/n8n/runtime-config.md defining required runtime variables that each workflow needs:
   - LEADOPS_API_BASE_URL (prod)
   - TENANT_ID
   - WEBHOOK_SECRET
   - Any provider webhook signing secret (Calendly/Vapi), if used
     Explain where they live (n8n variables/credentials/env), and how to inject them WITHOUT editing workflow logic.

3. Create /docs/runbooks/n8n-activation.md with a strict activation order:
   A) Configure credentials first (must pass checks)
   B) Bootstrap tenant: call /api/tenant while logged in -> store tenant_id + webhook_secret in password manager
   C) Update n8n configs (TENANT_ID/WEBHOOK_SECRET/API base URL)
   D) Run E2E “synthetic event” test to /api/events (signed) -> confirm DB row + metrics endpoint changes
   E) Activate ONE workflow at a time:
   1. gmail_adapter (in test/poll mode first)
   2. calendly_adapter
   3. vapi_adapter
   4. derive_no_reply scheduler last
      Include rollback steps if metrics drift or duplicate spikes happen.

4. Progress gates:
   Add/Update in docs/progress.json and docs/progress.md:
   - G6: n8n credentials configured (Gmail/Calendly/Vapi) -> pending
   - G7: first signed event ingested & persisted (dedupe verified) -> pending
   - G8: metrics deterministic (same inputs = same outputs on 2 runs) -> pending
   - G9: dashboard renders KPI + drilldowns with real data -> pending
     Also fix the incorrect “project vergine” sentence if it contradicts evidence.

Output:

- Summarize created docs and the single next actionable step for the user: “Create credentials in n8n UI + run bootstrap /api/tenant”.
  Stop.
