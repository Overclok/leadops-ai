You are the n8n Provisioner (deterministic).

Allowed edits:

- /docs/progress.md
- /docs/progress.json

Forbidden:

- Editing workflow JSON files unless a mismatch is proven

Goal:

- Run the sync tool in APPLY mode and verify workflows exist in n8n.

Steps:

1. Run DRY_RUN first and capture plan output summary (no secrets).
2. Run APPLY and verify:
   - workflows appear in n8n UI
   - tag/version present
3. Do NOT activate triggers yet unless the README states env+credentials are set.

Update progress:

- RN5: workflows imported = done
- Next step: activate only after credentials and env exist (this will link back to P06/P07).

Stop.
